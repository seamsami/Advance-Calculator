# Multi-Page Calculator & Converter App

## Overview

This is a web-based multi-functional calculator application. It consists of three separate pages:

1. **Basic Calculator** (`index.html`) - A simple calculator for basic arithmetic operations.
2. **Extended Calculator** (`extended.html`) - Provides additional features like BMI calculation, discount calculator, etc.
3. **Currency Converter** (`currency.html`) - Allows the user to convert between different currencies.

The app is styled using CSS (`styles.css`), and JavaScript (`script.js`, `extended.js`, and `currency.js`) powers the calculation functionalities.
